<h1>Stroud's Auction Service</h1>>

<p>
My project will be redoing an idea I had in the past for my cousins auction service. He wants an online front to advertise and share for his auctions. This site will show the upcoming auctions with pictures and information about the sale.
</p>
<h1> Database</h1>
<p>The database file will be constantly updated whenever a new auction is scheduled. This will then post the new information to the spot on the webpage. This database may include some single items as well. This could be items that he will sell singly and not during an auction. The only issue is changing the document constantly would be the only time consuming part that will kept up by me. Luckily I help out so it will be something that I will be around. </p>

<h1>Client Side and Views</h1>
<p> 
The client end will be written in angular probably as 4 separate pages. A home page, meet the Auctioneer, upcoming auctions and a contact page. On the contact page will be linked to the Facebook page. I am not to sure of how I want to go out it yet. I was thinking more of either a rustic or retro vibes.The client side is the 2nd most important part of the website, information being first.

Once I have a better understanding of Angular then this part will be better to try to describe what will happen. Any input is appreciated.
